# AsynchronismCourseJS
<p>In this course, I learned the principal structures of JS to work with asyncronism: call backs, promises and sync and await, and doing some challenges with APIs.</p>

## Asynchronism
<p>JavaScript is a syncronism langueaje, it executes its on a first-come, first-served basis. JavaScript has event loop, it takes care of visualizing all the input and output processes.</p>

## Callbacks
<p>It's a function that receives another function as a parameter, to execite a process asynchronously.</p>

# First Challenge
<p>In the first challenge, I make a request to an API, using xmlhttp.</p>

## XMLHTTP
It's a JavaScript object designed by Microsoft, to make requests to web servers.

## Install
We can install this dependency through npm with the following command: npm install xmlhttprequest

<p>With this, we can use all the xmlhttp methods and successfully make our requests.</p>

# Promises
<p>It uses the promise object to be executed now, later or never.</p>
